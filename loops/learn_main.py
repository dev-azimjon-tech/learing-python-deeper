# # for loop - iterates over a sequence(list,tuple,string , etc.)
# # while loop - repeats as long as a condtion is True


# # For loop:
# # Basic syntax:
# # for item in itarable:
# #     pass
#     # do something


# # Code example:
# for num in [1,2,3]:
#     print(num)


# # Looping with range:

# for i in range(5):
#     print(i)

# # or

# for j in range(1,6):
#     print(j)



# Code example for while loop:
# count = 0

# while count < 6:
#     print(count)
#     count += 1
